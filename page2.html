       <h1>Why do i study CSE?</h1>
       <p>When i commit to studying a subject the minimum i want is to know that your future is secure. Traditionally, computer science graduates would move into programming and software engineering. However, as the influence of computing continues to grow, graduates can also expect to be offered positions in other departments.Having a computing degree will provide me with the knowledge, problem-solving skills and logical thinking capabilities that serve as a competitive advantage in my career. I can launch scientific innovation â€“ the human genome project, AIDS research and environmental protection are three areas boosted by Computer Science.</p>
